## Description

I have used Sanity as a database for storing product information. Sanity allows a user-friendly interface to add products anytime we want. Sanity also gives the ability to change product information like price, rating, images, etc.

Used redux for managing states like cart items, quantities, etc.

For payments, I have used Stripe, which also has an amazing API to handle various kinds of payments. Stripe allows users to enter their card information along with their address and validates that request.

The website includes a products section where users can add items to the cart and add or remove extra items, and users can see the subtotal by clicking on the cart icon on the top right section of the page. The cart gives an overview of what items the user has selected along with the subtotal.
